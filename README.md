dtcalc (date/time calculator)
======

dtcalc is a simple command line date/time calculator licensed under GPL v3.

it means that you can add or remove a number from today or some rbitrary dates and see the result.
the same thing is true for time.

for complete list of options please use -h or --help switch:
:) dtcalc -h

dtcalc is written completely in scheme, i use chicken compiler to compile the code, and some of the chicken
egg! and extensions are used that makes the code chicken limited, so in order to compile the code in other
scheme compilers like guile, chibit, etc you have to change some parts of the code which I discourage it.

if you have any question send me an email (sepehr.aryani@gmail.com)
